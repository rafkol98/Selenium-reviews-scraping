# Selenium-reviews-scraping
Web scraping using Selenium to gather customer reviews from TrustPilot for a company of interest (I selected one at random). The collected data was then analyzed utilizing a sentiment analysis model, with the aim of classifying the reviews as positive or negative.

This was developed mainly to practice web scraping using Selenium.
