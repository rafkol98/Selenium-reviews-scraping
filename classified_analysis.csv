0,"I’ve had to be on the phone a couple times with Valda. Both times I’ve had only a small duration on their hold time, and each representative has been both friendly, and very helpful. My experience with them has been positive so far. This can’t be said for other energy companies I’ve had the displeasure of communicating with. Thank you for standing out, Valda.",2023-01-19,POSITIVE,2023

2,"Absolutely avoid this company at all costs! There should be a zero star option. Not one person on their call lines has the slightest clue what they're doing, get told I'm on a fixed rate contract where I only pay for what I use with a smart meter....... smart meter never gets fitted apparently due to my area, I get constant 'estimates' that keep putting me in the red and not one person knows what's going on with my account, all they keep phoning me for is more money, saying I'm on daily estimates etc. They are rip off merchants, rude, extortionate, and completely incompetent at their jobs. Imagine everyone was this bad at their job!!! Absolute joke of a company! AVOID AVOID AVOID",2023-01-18,NEGATIVE,2023
3,I switched through a guy called Craig from commercial electricity suppliers. I thought its a genuine guy even though I get thousand calls a day for energy switching for business for lower prices.I changed my energy from old supplier to Valda after Craig Said that it will be £210 a month fixed. After signing up I received first email from the company owing them £968 for no reason before even starting energy with Valda. They need £500 for third party charges. I m not responsible for your spam calls and charges. You deal with your third party yourself. I am not paying anything not used for. I am switching to different company.They said that they recorded the calls then where is your fixed price of £210 a month and where do £968 come from? Are you scram like lot of companies out their on public money?,2023-01-19,NEGATIVE,2023

13,"We spoke to Tania this morning and she is the first person of many to actually resolve the issue we had! I have previously spoken to a few people that said they would look into our account and come back to us and then they didn’t bother, I’ve also spoken to others that weren’t interested in listening to my issue and just kept telling me how much I owed,  today, finally Tania resolved our issue and we are going to be reimbursed over £800 as we knew was owed to us. She was also very polite! Maybe Tania could train some of the other members of the team that can’t resolve customer’s problems.",2022-12-29,POSITIVE,2022
14,"My bill gone from £400 a month to £1,600 a month. My gas bill is £60 a day when contact them in September when the bill went upto that price they notice on the system and would arrange for it to be investigated. Received my invoice in October still extremely high so called again over an hour just waiting for someone to pick up the call. Busy in salon November and December. But however when closed in salon I kept an eye on the bill as I cleared it off and didn't expect it to increase to £418 whilst a salon closed. Check the gas meter and the dial turning when everything off. I've emailed them and message them to get someone out. The response is its fine it's working. When everything off it should not be turning very fast where you can't see the red numbers!! They threatened me that I can't leave my contract. I check online cab leave contract got to give 6weeks notice. The safety how they left a broken gas meter in my building since September and not investigated at all",2023-01-09,NEGATIVE,2023
15,"Advisors all lovely on phone but tried several times ringing to pay - option 3 and it cuts me off, happens all the time. Also when I log in online and request a new password - email never arrives. Bills always need amending, don’t understand why when I have a smart meter? And no response to emails when a question needs to be answered. Thanks",2022-12-20,NEGATIVE,2022
16,I realised that i needed to talk to someone about my account. I tried two telephone numbers and was put on hold on both of them with the calls never answered. I eventually agreed to a call back on one of them but the other one cut me off. When they eventually called me back the caller was very helpful and i sorted the problem out.,2022-12-19,NEGATIVE,2022
17,Priyanka was very helpful and answered my query exceptionally.,2023-01-17,POSITIVE,2023
18,"I had problems, a significant one in that I was being charged the wrong rate, but the person to whom I spoke, Jamie Lee, was knowledgeable and helpful.  She seems to have put things right.  That is the reason for 5 stars.  Getting the rate wrong would pitch my view towards 2 stars.  So would the fact that you are not able to get readings from the smart meter installed 7 Nov and have not followed up on the initial email warning me of that.  So, in summary, a pretty mixed bag but Jamie Lee and in a previous call on a different topic, Nicole or Nicola, are your real assets",2022-12-21,NEGATIVE,2022
19,"If you hear Valda - run fast and far as you can. It has been for me the worst nightmare ever!!!!!!!!!!!!They just took money of me, disgusting....Valda supposed to get my credit money back, yet it didn't happened....They just get money from you...(more than you suppose to pay).

20,"We are going to contact the ombudsman. The old tenant had contract with them and wanted to move, but they forced them to get us involved by asking us write a letter as a proof that the old tenant moved since when so that they could let them free etc. then they used that letter to trap us into their contact. This not make sense at all, as we haven’t agreed and sign any contract with them. They kept sending us bills, and asked us to pay , wth?  They use our metter from the previous tenant without our permission and then based that to billing us. Such a disgusting company. Luckily, They do not have any our personal informations, or banking details etc,We are not contacting you by any chance . We will contact the ombudsman directly.",2022-12-27,NEGATIVE,2022
21,"Since I have been with my them it’s been nothing but nightmares not good customer service management’s are rude, it takes forever for them to respond to your concern and they will sometime take triple the amount money from your account because of wrong estimates.To make a complaint you have to wait for someone to call you in order to do so and can take up to 2 weeks to do so by chasing them up. Would not recommend them to no one. Check they reviews most are negative and that is what should have done before signing.",2022-04-17,NEGATIVE,2022
22,"The Date I signed the contract with them the wholesale price for electricity (as I have only now found out) was just 35ppkwh and yet they (and all the other electric companies) on the day were quoting 72+ppkwh. So now I'm stuck paying 72.24-21.1(government discount) =51.14ppkwh and the government scheme ending in March will see 72ppwkh , 360% hike from what I was paying :( Mercenary b******** !",2022-12-12,NEGATIVE,2022

Its prepayment, not credit, so I have offered to top it up.They have refused to let me add credit to the meter. My property has 90p left on the meter with a standing charge is about 30p a day so 3 days left without using electric before cut off, they have said they are closed until next year, and then an extra 3-5 days to do a change of tenancy with a possible completion date of 8th January.How are we meant to have power.

28,A rip off company using dodgy broker who mislead the customer. I was not aware we were dealing with a broker when discussing this service. They are telling me Sudbury Dry Iining   signed into a contract for 2 years at highly expensive rates. A contract that they say was verbally agreed over the phone. We as a company never agree to contracts for more than 1 year. These are a rip off company please be aware of their scams. I await a call from them to discuss this supposed contract. I will contract trading standard asap if they fail to contact me on 01895632806 to discuss immediately,2022-12-08,NEGATIVE,2022
29,After signing up with Valda Energy within 5 days of this they took £1124.48 out of my account without my permission. Given what i have used so far and the cost per Kwh my monthly usage will be around £600.00. Where did the £1124.48 come from and what gives you the right to deduct this from my account with no request or bill to show usage. Extremely poor service. If all I'm going to get back is we are sorry to hear this and please call customer services don't bother i will be reporting you.,2022-12-02,NEGATIVE,2022
30,"I have been with valda for my existing business and it had been great, I took on a new business and the switch over was good. But i had large estimated usage with £200 - £300 coming out regular. I called and was told this was estimated and if i keep sending in readings it would sort itself ... I did that but just before Christmas you took £4000 this made me over drawn and coused me grief with other suppliers You have now sorted this i believe and refunded but this has still cost me charges and stress so very un impressed . I was told later on a call that my readings would not have been accepted so i asked why no one had called me but they say its my responsibility as per agreement ! poor service .  I am hoping it will now all be ok but worry about others switching to yourselves. I was lucky i could borrow at this time otherwise my business could have been shut down before it had a chance. All it would have taken was some one on my first call to know what might happen and asked for a photo of meeting as and when required. on the upside your prices are very good.",2022-12-27,NEGATIVE,2022

47,Valda quoted me 86p kW and 81p daily rate. As I got a quote 25% cheaper they immediately increased my rate to £3 per day and £1.15 kW. This is an empty unused 800 sqft shop with occasional light usage and for 3 weeks they charged me £165. They said they could reduce and backdate the charges if I entered contract with them. Effectively blackmail! Steer away as they are truly rogues!,2022-10-07,NEGATIVE,2022

50,"Before we sold the business 4 months ago I found the customer service with Valda appalling. I informed them that the business was being sold and the contact details of the new owners. I have since had invoices and correspondence coming to me and have now informed them a further 3 times that they are contacting the incorrect person and the incorrect correspondence address. However, I would not gamble on not hearing from them again. If you are looking for a gas or electricity supplier that leaves you hanging on the phone for hours, does not respond to queries, takes no notice of what you have to say and wastes your time even when you are no longer their contact, go with Valda.",2022-11-22,NEGATIVE,2022

53,"Since I have been with valda energy it been so stressful they over charge me even when I have given an Apdate reading  when I call to investigate my bill, nothing they say makes any sense They admit that there’s a mistake but never correct it and keep sending disconnected letters and I don’t owe them anything. They charge a month in advance so they invoice you 2 months bill which is always huge amount I worked out my bill with one of their customer service agent today and my bill was £560  a month but invoiced me for £2660 Be careful with them , they will course you too much stress you don’t need!!",2022-10-10,NEGATIVE,2022

My smart meter says I’ve used 96p.!I have been charged £500! Third party introduction costs which wasn’t mentioned when I signed up! I feel completely scammed and getting fobbed off with customer services. I’ve asked for a call back from a manager which hasn’t happened. This is appalling and not a good way to start a new business. I’m in debt before I’ve even started out. Avoid at all costs !!! SCAM,2022-10-28,NEGATIVE,2022

61,"Absolutely appalling customer service, especially a man on the credit team named Mark, he was extremely rude.

I appreciate this is not Valda's fault but was the information correct at the time I switched. Without this issue I would have given 5* as Valda themselves have done nothing wrong and their customer service is exceptional, all aspects of dealing with the company so far have been faultless, from switching to billing, navigating their web site and app is easy and user friendly. Give them a go but do check the tariffs carefully.",2022-10-20,POSITIVE,2022

I had a issue where someone i dont know switched my energy provider, yes i had large estimated bills, yes there were meter issues, but their customer service really did everything to sort it out. In particular Jamie-lee, she patiently listened to all my queries, was very empathetic and went over and above what i expected and resolved everything. She provided the best customer service i have ever experienced from an energy company. She even sent me a summary email of what we spoke about and communicated regularly to resolve the issues.

But if I signed up woth them they would back date the new rate to when the tenant went out . If not I would have to pay the outstanding bill , sounds a bit like blackmail to me ! Upon telling them I would not be staying with them they said I would be getting a big bill then . A week later and estimated bill for 1.5k arrives , for an empty unit *lol* .

106,Scammed by a caller saying valda would be my best option. Stating my current supplier had me on an emergency plan and they could save me loads of money . Basically promised my bill would be halved . As soon as I transfered rate went through the roof and they kept.tak9ng money from account . I've managed to stop that by asking them.to rove my card details and I'll top up as I go along . Pretty sure they are charging way over the government's maximum price!!! Will be reporting to omnibus and other complaint sectors . Such a shame we live in a world where they would happily scam small struggling business in a cost of living crisis. As soon as I can I am getting as far away from them as I can . I doubt they will be around much longer once everyone is released from contracts. The staff on the phone a really polite though so I have to give credit to them as there only doing there job and I imaging they get alot of angry customers daily,2022-11-04,NEGATIVE,2022

Just had a response to my review with the standard 'blah, blah, blah etc and asking me to contact them on a phone line I can never get through on, or use their webchat which from previous experience is handled by someone with instructions to fob you off with promises.",2022-08-06,NEGATIVE,2022

It’s double charge and very high bill. I tried to contact it about that, but no one responses it. So I contacted Valda on August and requested they issue invoice to me once per month in order to pay the bill once per month. It’s confirmed they issued invoice to me on 25th each month and direct debit me on 5th each month. But I just pay the bill on 05/09/22, and I saw that they will issue invoice to me on 20/09. So again I have to contacted this company this morning via website chat just now. It’s Daisy. She said they will issue invoice to me on 20/09 and charge me on 20/09.

136,DO NOT USE! I secured a price with Valda Energy back In May as our business contract is due to run out at the end of August. I had to pay a deposit on the account due to us being a business which I thought was strange but went with it. This morning I have been informed that Valda energy are no longer going going to honour the price agreed back in May as apparently our business is a pub. They allow restaurants but not pubs. When they were asked what they class as a restaurant they said McDonald’s or prezzo. However because we’re a restaurant which operates on a pub premises they won’t honour our agreed price. So it’s taken them since May to decide this! 2 weeks before we change over! Conveniently now prices are higher than ever! We’ve been well and truly screwed over by Valda energy! It will now cost me at least an extra £600 a week to open the doors to my business because of Valda Energy! I knew energy companies were being greedy however I didn’t realise they were out to throw people under the bus too! So unethical and very very poor practice! And I can’t believe they get away with it! One the contract was signed back in May there should have been no going back!,2022-08-18,NEGATIVE,2022

163,"Where do I even begin. I brought a cafe and the previous tenants were using Valda as their energy provider, I thought to keep things easy it would be best to stick with Valda(even though I had never heard of them, and the majority of people I’ve spoken to also haven’t). It happened to be the biggest mistake in my life. They took advantage of my naivety and I rushed into a two year contract at 82p/kw in these very uncertain times we currently live in. Valda charged me over a whopping £5000 in my first month for electricity where the previous tenants were paying roughly £700. We agreed to split that bill(will be important later on in my review)into weekly instalments which made it easier to pay. The customer service operatives do not have the power to do much so it is literally pointless speaking to them. I have asked to speak to managers and they always seem to be “out of office”. Fast forward to the gov energy relief scheme they told me both my unit rate for electricity and gas will definitely be reduced from the 1st October when the scheme begins. It is now almost December, 3 months from the introduction of the scheme and I am still being charged the same unit rate for my electricity. After many pointless attempts to get someone to explain why this has happened I was told “The reason it has not yet been added to your account is due to the adjustment we had on your billing, whilst this was getting resolved we were unable to add any new discounts onto your account.” If you’re unable to add new discounts on my account (which is a blatant lie, it’s a legal requirement for vulnerable businesses who entered into new contracts since December 2021) why was my gas discounted?And what does the adjustment(the first bill which we agreed to split into weekly installments) have anytning to to do with following bills?I requested to speak to a manager but surprise surprise they are “out of office” . I am still waiting for my electricity unit rate to be reduced as a result of the relief scheme. PLEASE STAY WELL AWAY FROM VALDA, THEY ARE THEIVING BA****DS. Every company has already began using  the relief scheme but Valda hasn’t. Worst experience with a company ever. MINUS 5 STARS",2022-10-09,NEGATIVE,2022

166,"Signed up for Valda Energy through bionic. The energy contract was set up on the wrong meter due to a geo location/tagging issue which sometimes happens. I informed valda of the situation in writing and over the phone and they told me they’d put my account on hold whilst the situation resolved. They then proceeded to debit my account almost immediately for approx £1400 for the incorrect meter. After going through numerous steps and conversations again to confirm the situation they agreed it was an incorrect meter and issued the refund. Around 2 months later it still hasn’t been received. The sheer incompetence of the customer support team begs belief. Constantly receive different answers, different time frames, contradicting information. My guess is that they are struggling financially and need to hold on to refunds etc for their own cash flow. I would avoid this company at all costs and go with a bigger supplier due to the energy crisis. A lot of smaller firms are being wiped out and wouldn’t surprise me if Valda were to go soon given they need to hold on to such small amounts for such a long time. Whilst the £1400 isn’t a lot, the principle of them taking the money from my account when they said it was on hold, then messing me about for months with the refund, and then still not having paid the refund. It’s a bit of a joke. Used SSE for my previous properties and whilst it’s difficult to love any energy company, at least they’re big and won’t go under and also respond to queries in a timely manner. One of the biggest mistakes and time drains I’ve made going with Valda energy. Heed the advice of this review and avoid at all costs!",2022-08-21,NEGATIVE,2022

168,"Don't ever go with Valda. It's been a year of stress. They're just thieves with a legal status. Everything was fine, until they installed their smart meter. My bills went from between £50 - £200 a month (more in winter than  summer) to over £1800 in 1 month! They claimed my consumption had gone up that much! I didn't even pay that much in 18 months prior to that in total. I would have to be running every electrical item I own for 13 hours a day every day to use this much electric. After this, my VAT went from 5% to 20% & climate change levvy was added to every bill.I've tried to resolve the issue for over a year. They keep threatening disconnection if I don't pay the outstanding amount. I've spoken to tons of people for hours, I've emailed endlessly, I've written to the ombudsman. The replies I get are that the due amount was ""reconciliation"" from before the smart meter was installed. Or that my consumption must have gone up that much in one month! We used our electricity as normal & the business was in fact closed for 2 weeks over the Christmas break, so if anything our consumption should have been less. I've had an electrician in to check my electrical items are working fine which they are, I've had someone in to check the meter was installed properly which it is. In trying to resolve the issue, I've been given so many different amounts that I owe, ranging from £1800 to over £3000, from the same company at the same time. It seems they just pluck figures from the air to charge you random amounts. They took the money from my account, which I had to recall from the bank. They took the money from my card, which I then had to block. I have continued to pay my normal consumption charges, but refuse to pay the stupid bill from when they changed to their smart meter, the 20% vat & climate change levvy (this is only added when your electric consumption is over a certain amount). The issue is still ongoing with the ombudsman. Go with another company. Don't sign with Valda.",2022-08-26,NEGATIVE,2022

172,"This has got to be THE worst business electric company in the world, signed up for a 3 year contract (very much regret doing this now) from day one of the contract they have been very consistant at getting the billing wrong, the latest one in a long line of mistakes by them is a £3,000 bill (I just paid over £1k a week ago) because they have rebilled the entire period of usage and is due in 10 days or they will disconnect the power to my aquatic pet shop putting the lives of my stock at risk all because they billed wrong, they makes the mistakes and expect you to cover it. DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTACT WITH THESE COWBOYS YOU WILL END UP REGRETTING IT, Go with British gas lite I never had any problems with them.RESPONSE TO REPLY FROM VALDA1. we are not talking about an initial delay, we are talking about repeated and continus credit and rebilling the latest 10 days after I paid what I was told I owed2. ""you encourage customers to pay for their actual usage"" I have paid all bills for usage presented by your company on time and in full, however expecting me to pay a 2nd bill within 10 days because you made mistakes is unreasonable, and to then threaten cut off because of your mistake is down right unbelievable. 3. I was advised by your customers service as I'm a commercial customer you don't have to do anything and expect payment within 10 days all this a week after I have paid my last bill, your company has a lot to learn about customer relations, accepting when you have made the error and compromising to help reach a resolution.Your surgestion on saving money is just erroneous the issue is not my ability to save on my bills, it's yours on how and when you present your bills and more over your payment demands on extra bills for usage you just found out was used over a 6 months period but want paying for now. I would love to brake this contract I bet delboy would be a better supplier than yourselves.4. Your offer to setup a 'reasonable payment plan' us a joke I've spoken to your collections team before leaving the review the offer is to pay over 4 weeks as a maximum period not reasonable at all.

183,"Disshonest, unlawful, and useless. An absolute disgrace of a company. They have conned us into a 3 year tarriff that is over priced.We signed up with EDF. 2 days later we get a call from 'EDF' who can't complete the switch (our meter has been de-energized apparently), but, 'don't worry, I will send an urgent e-mail to a company that can find you a supplier so you're not on the out of contract tariff for too long.' 30 mins later we get call from someone who basically says the only company that deals with 'de energized' meters is Valda. It's made out like that is our only option so we proceed. The next day, getting suspicious I call EDF. They have not called us, there are no issues with the switch.A week later and Valda have taken over, they put the request in before EDF as they give no cooling off period for business accounts.They don't care we were scammed, it's not their fault and not their problem, we are under contract and that is the end of it as far as they are concerned.Honestly, I don't wish bad on anyone but I hope this company goes bust and all their disshonest staff get conned too.

I would 100% suggest you do not use this company, or any of their dishonest, agents.We are having to seek legal advice.Addition: Irrespective of their seemingly ‘willing’ reply below, don’t be fooled.

Within three months they'd taken over £900 from our account after we changed over to them in October 21 because 'we didn't have a smart meter'  Eventually they fitted one.  Our account is still over £900 in credit and they are not refunding us despite agreeing to with the ombudsman.  Just about to escalate the complaint.  Customer service atrociousUpdateAs we have exchanged upteem emails and phone calls with Valda customer service, their comment is inappropriate.  However we have now received our refund and everything is working well.  Thank you Valda. If you are thinking of joining Valda, make sure you have plenty of monthly meter reading to give them, that they install your smart meter immediately when you switch, and if they take too much money, cancel your debit card or direct debit straight away.",2022-07-11,NEGATIVE,2022
213,"We've been with Valda since start of 2022 and have had a mixed experience.  The initial consumption was massively overestimated despite us having a smart meter which the previous supplier could access accurately which resulted in a massive overclaim via dd, which was as much as 6 months consumption.  For a charity this was a big shock, so I cancelled the dd and went to a credit payment.  Eventually, after giving regular readings and sending photos, they agreed that something wasn't right and we got a credit back. However, I have to supply at least 3 readings a week on the on-line portal or the default goes back to the erroneous anticipated consumption.  Valda then took a card payment without my permission which has put us in credit and still 1 month after the payment was taken, we are more than £1k in credit which equates to 66 days useage.As with all utilities it's hard to get through on the phone, but if you get the right person they will sort it out for you.Jury is still out on if we'll renew in 2023.",2022-07-09,NEGATIVE,2022

Lizz listened to my description of the problems, was polite and professional and actioned the issue promptly. 10/10 to Lizz !!   Some reviewers describe their problems dealing with Valda ( and other companies too ) BUT if you approach such a company in a structured, reasonable manner all the issues can be easily fixed.

He has English as a second language and they have sent him part (not all) of the recording of the discussion between the broker and him- we have listened to it and it’s quite clear that he doesn’t really understand what’s going on as he is signed up to an extortionate business contract. Having read a review below- this appears to be a repeating pattern of behaviour from this company. I have contacted the local MP and will be contacting OFGEM tomorrow. Disgraceful behaviour- unethical and discriminatory.,2022-06-10,NEGATIVE,2022

288,"when joining up, I asked to pay £300 per month so I would be up front in winter when my Business uses much more power for Kennels heating and lighting. You have never done this, and have even pestered me to pay in more money even tho` I was well in credit. I have kept an eye on my usage and paid in extra to ensure that I`m always in credit, but on months when I didn`t use £300 you should have still taken £300 ! that way you wont be saying I need to put in £600 or whatever when I do use more.

A couple of days later they took £800 out of my account with out any warning!! You can not do this! I did not you permission or give you my bank details to save! I contacted them which they stated this was estimated from March to May and I could not get this money back.. The guy on the phone was very helpful don’t get me wrong at the time I thought he was brilliant, he told me if I set up a direct debit and submitted meter reads at the start of every month that no money will be taken out of my account with out warning. Today I checked my Valda App which I have an invoice for over £1000 which comes out in 2 days time when I paid £800 last Friday!!  Can someone please tell me where you have for this figure from as my shop isn’t even open yet so how can you justify charging me £1000 when I haven’t even submitted a meter read and was told that no money would be taken from my account if I set up a direct debit!! I am a small hairdressing business and I can not afford this. I am spending every penny I have renovating my shop which isn’t even open yet and you are charging me these prices when the previous tenant was paying £159 a month with British Gas!!

They now keep selling the non existing debt to collection companies who hassle us and then stop when they realise they have been scammed by Valda. It seems to me they overcharge everyone massively, say its a mistake and then sell the debt, people then leave them after paying for electricity they have not had. Make sure you record every email and phone call and sit tight. Do not leave with them owing you money. They are simply a licensed mafia. Looking forward to court.",2022-05-10,NEGATIVE,2022

323,"Honestly it is quite ironic how in March they got 1 star ratings and in April they have got 4 or 5 stars. I wouldn't put it passed this company if they paid their employees an incentive to make their online rating look better. Absolutely shocking service. You’ll feel like a sucker if you join. Initially i genuinely thought great, so easy to sign up. But none stop hassle ever since. Bills for our small salon coming up to £300+, the customer service team will tell you what you want to hear until you refuse to pay a bill because you’re asking for answers. The advisors told me that my smart meter could have been installed wrong but it would cost us to send an engineer out- why? When as a company you can’t tell us why our bills have shot up. Honestly avoid this company, if you like an easy life just avoid this company i cant express to you how much they’ve lied. Everyone contradicts themselves, when you believe one person the other one can’t find notes on the system. Bionic will tell you everything you want to hear and are so polite when you sign up e.g that you’ll pay less, you can come to us if you’re unhappy (but you can’t). I was even told that no other company could supply us in our area to only find our later on there was a glitch on the compare website and they could but in order to get sign ups they lied! I genuinely dont believe the good reviews and you shouldn’t either. If you sign up you will regret it. Ombudsman have been informed.

However 13th December 2021 the smart meter was installed and the energy bills went up to £295+ other months it was £380 I am a small business so I have rate relief so you can imagine how small my shop is and I am appointment only, bridal boutique! The customer service is horrendous and no one wants to give the right information! They enjoy sending clients around and around! I have now left the premises however it took them two month to sort out and the landlord wanted to move suppliers however they wanted to keep the 'clock' to king to gain as much money as possible so they made him wait two months before they realised the line. Today 19th April 2022 they have finally agreed to realise the line and let him go to a new supplier, this should have take no more than 10days to complete. Robbing money grabbing thiefs!

Have tried to contact by phone or by their chat  no joy. I feel very vulnerable as these people seem like frauds.  Have contacted Ofgem, waiting to hear what they can do.

Smart meter reading differs to theirs then they just randomly take £100s of pounds out the business account without notice. Terrible company.

As a small family run business we cannot afford to have this amount of money withdrawn from our account weekly and was not advised that they would be requesting these sums of money when we signed up. Sent an email with meter readings and photographs and they advised account was in credit but still taking money! Advised only payment method is via direct debit or card details, I have cancelled all payments and advised I will pay via BACS or cheque when billed with a meter reading – to date I am still awaiting a response via email!

Wanted me to take readings to send to them (what is the smart meter for?)

415,"I recently changed to Valda Energy from British Gas Business.It's a landlords supply for a communal entrance to 3 flats - the supply powers one high efficiency storage heater set to 16 degrees Celsius, and 4 light bulbs - all low energy LED.On changing, my supply charges went up 8p/unit on the day rate, and 6p/unit on the night rate.  I knew this and accepted the increased rates, particularly as the standing charge reduced from 32p/day to 20p/day.  I thought this acceptable for a supply with such low usage. I expected the bills to go up slightly - perhaps a few £s per month, but they've actually quadrupled!Since changing to Valda, my bills have actually gone up from around £30/month, to £110/month.  When I spoke to them to highlight the obvious error in their billing, they stated my bills were correct and that all I could do was employ an electrician to check the meter to see if it's faulty!  It wasn't faulty when BG were supplying it 2 months ago!I simply cannot accept that these figures can be right, but Valda are not interested in investigating whether or not there could be an error somewhere.I wish I'd never switched and would advise others to stay well clear.",2022-01-28,NEGATIVE,2022

The readout on the meter was defective when we took the shop on and it has taken them 3 months to install a new one.  They are still trying to take more money from our account with no authorisation or invoicing. Starting a business is stressfull enough without the cold theft this company continues to exert.UPDATE : Thought I had this sorted, the account was put in dispute, I thought until we had a resolution, then less than a week later, another dip into my pockets with no invoice or justification....

442,"If I could put zero stars, I would. I switched to Valda Energy in September/October 2021, as I am a brand new business and they offered the best pricing. They promised they would never overcharge and that everything would be done via a ""Smart meter"" which they would install. The first issue came about when I emailed multiple times to come have the smart meter installed, with no replies - finally 3 months later, received a reply that my meter already was smart so they didn't need to install. Ok, fine.I then asked if I could receive an invoice, as I'd had multiple large sums taken out of my account with zero invoicing information. The first amount was a random £995.18, which I did not approve - I argued to get this money back, and was finally refunded £950. Since then, I've been charged £52.92, £323.70, £502.60, and £488.60, adding up to £1367.82 overall, all taken with zero invoicing. Finally received an invoice for my first 3 months - I only owed them £363.60! Why has all this extra money been taken out of my account?!?!Then the ultimate kicker - when I FINALLY got my invoice, it WASN'T EVEN THE RIGHT METER. I've now been trying to get them to update all the information and refund me and everytime you call they can't help at all, just tell you to email, then when you email you never hear back from them. I STRONGLY regret signing with this company and would recommend do not, I repeat, DO NOT sign up to this absolute scam of a company. Just pay a bit extra for an actual company that can operate like a real business rather than constantly giving you the run around and taking random giant sums out of a small business account.EDIT: They've now been in touch, and they've said they will be cancelling my account and refunding me all money.

I have just got off a call with someone called Liz, her hands were tied behind her back but she did do her best to be as helpful as possible, i am now waiting to hear from a Manager before getting in touch with Ofgem as we seem to be in a deadlock.- The bad - Right from the start I suppose this was bound to fail, the broker lied - stated he worked for Valda (obviously this part of the call isn't recorded), lucky for me during the 6 1/2 minute call that is recorded it does become clear i was dealing with a broker who is keen to lie to close the contract and that I was on a building site so I was distracted + interrupted a few times - this was stated by Liz.- There collections department call you and e-mail you and use literally what you could only describe as bullying tactics. - We are in a 9-month lease on these premises, so I do know I only need to deal with this for another 8 months before never having to deal with this company again - I offered to pay a final bill as long it was a final bill just so we never have to deal with Valda again - Fact i know we are being ripped off and am happy to be ripped off just to end this dreadful experience should speak volumes - the cost to get out of this contract seems worth it as this is genuinely such a big headache. I even stated it is best for both parties, they would just be wasting resources on me and money essentially, chasing something I will be passing over to Ofgem & our solicitors to deal with.- E-mails have 4 different figures that we owe them- Meter reads are meant to be accurate - how can they be accurate? Liz stated to me on Dec 2nd my energy consumption was 23kw - every other day we use 4x that amount? Our shop was open on Dec 2nd...we do nothing different. - They want me to pay for the electrician to come out and check out a faulty meter Honestly, if you are considering this company just save yourself the headache.",2021-12-22,NEGATIVE,2021

It's utterly disgusting. They tried to take over £3000 from my account in a month! We are only small business and can’t afford paying ridiculous energy bills.

They have taken £1700 from me and have still not refunded me £1000 of this. furthermore I phoned up two days ago to find that twice the photo evidence I submitted for meter readings was not uploaded, which is needed for my refund. they took money from my personal account as I had used that to make the initial activation payment but had given no permission or informed that they would take first payment from this account. I have read the terms and agreements and it states that you can cancel if a smart meter cannot be installed within a set time of activation and they are unable to meet this so I attempted to cancel but was told it was due to Covid, but it does not state this as part of the cancelation terms. I will be writing a formal complaint next and making contact with the Energy Ombudsman to discuss this matter as I believe that they are acting unethically as it the broker, who I shall also be making a complaint too on this matter as they have I believe acted neglectfully.

565,"Absolutely FANTASTIC service from Tyler Candler at Valda Energy.  He has a great knowledge of the product and was very informative and extremely professional.I had spoken with other energy providers and did not receive the same quality of customer service as Tyler at Valda Energy.  It's such a breath of fresh air to be able to pick up the phone and get straight through to a human instead of an automated service which puts you on hold for hours on end.  If only more businesses head the same ethos as Valda Energy and Tyler, the world would be a much better place.  Thank you Tyler and Valda Energy, I very much look forward to you supplying my business fuel.",2020-12-14,POSITIVE,2020
566,"Mel was very friendly, helpful and fast and was able to offer a competitive price for electricity. Unfortunately she appeared to have very little knowledge about the product itself and perhaps little understanding of issues around climate change/sustainability.  Unfortunately the process itself means that you agree the contract verbally over the phone, and do not get the opportunity to read the terms and conditions thoroughly before agreeing the contract and there is no cooling down period. There were a number of issues I picked up in the T & Cs that did not completely add up for me. In addition they use Barclays Bank, I and many people use the term ""dirty banks"" (huge investments in fossil fuels etc etc) and I would expect any ethically based company providing 100% renewable energy would avoid being associated with these banks. However an email and a chat with Callum, the customer care team leader, about my concerns meant that I was able to cancel my contract immediately. My view is that this company appears great for competitive prices but I would check out the T & Cs carefully before signing. I think this company need to look at their values, ethics and staff training around climate change and our climate emergency otherwise they might find themselves in the position of being tarred as ""greenwashing"".",2020-12-10,NEGATIVE,2020
567,"Mr Tyler Candler is very polite and very kind, and he is very simple and clear about the products, and he answered my phone within 10 seconds. and valda energy price also good. it was a very nice experience. I am happy and impressed.",2020-12-10,POSITIVE,2020

571,"Service does not get better than this, Both Tyler and Charley were very helpful in opening our new account. The app is great, and the annual prices are far better than we were quoted by eon, british gas and n power, and a fixed two year contract for peace of mind. Also its nice when the phone is answered quickly and the staff are all UK based, we just moved from British gas where a simple call is an hour lost as the queue waiting time is crazy and then its a call centre in a foreign country and all the associated problems with that. Already recommending other business friends.. thanks",2020-11-10,POSITIVE,2020
572,"Was literally conned into signing up with Valda by a dishonest broker, asked Valda to release me from contract because of this but they refused. Since then I have had nothing but issues they have taken money from my account that shouldn't have been taken. They continue to estimate bills while claiming bills are accurate. Contact customer service who appear to be highly trained pacifiers but issues do not get resolved. Would strongly advise against using them.",2020-11-06,NEGATIVE,2020

And I had cancelled my direct debit as you tried to bill me £800 whilst I had been shut due to COVID for nearly 5 months, as again you failed to collect accurate data from me you finally took a read after 8 months of being with your company, your company is a waste of time and a joke complaints have been made and your customer service team need some training",2020-10-13,NEGATIVE,2020
